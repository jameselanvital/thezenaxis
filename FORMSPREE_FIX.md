# Formspree Integration Fix

## The Problem
The React contact form was using **controlled components** (React state) which interfered with Formspree's form submission:

```javascript
// ❌ PROBLEM: Controlled inputs with React state
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({...})

<Input
  value={formData.name}
  onChange={(e) => handleInputChange('name', e.target.value)}
  name="name"
/>
```

## The Solution
Changed to **uncontrolled components** (no React state) like the working HTML version:

```javascript
// ✅ SOLUTION: Uncontrolled inputs (like HTML)
<Input
  name="name"
  // No value or onChange props
/>
```

## Why This Works
- **HTML Form**: Uses native form submission → ✅ Works
- **React Controlled**: Form data managed by React state → ❌ Conflicts with Formspree
- **React Uncontrolled**: Form data managed by browser → ✅ Works like HTML

## Key Changes Made
1. Removed `useState` for form data
2. Removed `value` and `onChange` props from inputs
3. Replaced custom Select components with native `<select>` elements
4. Let Formspree handle all form data through native form submission

The form now works exactly like your simple HTML test file!
